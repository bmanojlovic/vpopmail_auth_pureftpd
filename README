This is what you need if you want to use pureftpd for authentication
purposes with pureftpd with any db backend in vpopmail because
it needs vpopmail installed (suprisingly :] )
and need user vpopmail in /etc/passwd (if vpopmail installed as it should be 
than it will be there)

anyway type:
./configure 
make

and then copy created executable wherever you need to use it

Be warned this is rather old code so be kind with bug reports :)
